# IDPTracker
This repository hosts our code for our paper ***Online Multi-Object Tracking via Identity Propagation***.

### Requirements
- Python3.6  
- Pytorch 1.6.0, torchvision 0.7.0  
- python-opencv  
- py-motmetrics  

### Installation
[DCNv2](https://github.com/jinfagang/DCNv2_latest)  
[PrRoIPooling](https://github.com/vacancy/PreciseRoIPooling)  

### Quick Start
#### Dataset Zoo
Our method is designed for public detection mode. The preprocessed detection files can be found [here(Learning a Neural Solver for Multiple Object Tracking)](https://github.com/dvl-tum/mot_neural_solver)
